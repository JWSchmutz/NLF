                        <h3>About blueberries</h3>Commercially grown blueberries in the United States are primarily of
                        three types with many varieties of each type. The three types are
                        Highbush (grown in colder climates north of us), Rabbiteye (grown in
                        this region) and Southern Highbush (grown in warmer climates south of
                        us). Fortunately, Rabbiteye varieties have the least problems with
                        disease. We grow more than a dozen varieties of Rabbiteye blueberries
                        so that some variety is available from mid June through early August.</p>

                        <h3>Better than organic</h3>
                        <p>It is a common misconception that organic means the produce is not sprayed with
                            pesticides. Organic means the grower only uses OMRI listed
                            pesticides and fertilizers. There are several thousand OMRI approved
                            pesticides. Our policy is to not use any pesticides at all unless
                            there is a problem and then only OMRI listed pesticides. So far we
                            have been fortunate to not have to spray at all most years. We do,
                            however, use mineral blueberry fertilizer which has no negative
                            effects on the blueberries.</p>
