          <h3>What's in a name?</h3>
          <p>
            New Life Farm has a double meaning. The first is the “new life” of
            farming for our second career after retiring from Southern Wesleyan
            University - Chemistry (Jim) and SC Extension Service – Food Safety
            (Pam). The second meaning is in honor of the transformation that the
            Gospel of Jesus Christ brings to our lives.

              <h3>What is the GOSPEL?</h3>
              <p>
                The word gospel comes from the Old English gōdspel which means
                good news. It is a translation of the Greek “evangelium”. So,
                what is this good news?
              </p>
              <p>
                Many people believe you have to live a very good life, although
                they know they haven't. Then when you die you have to take your
                chances because you cannot know in this life if you will make
                it, indeed you cannot even know if God exists. Part of the good
                news is that none of this is true.
              </p>
              <p class="text-center">
                <strong>This would be bad news, but is widely believed</strong>
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  You have to live a good life to be accepted by God and earn
                  your way into heaven.
                </li>
                <li>You cannot know if God has accepted you in this life.</li>
              </ol>
              <p class="text-center"><strong>This is the good news.</strong></p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  God accepts you first and then empowers you to live a good
                  life.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You know you are accepted when God transforms you by His Holy
                  Spirit.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                God requires payment for our sin, but he paid it Himself through
                the sacrificial death of His Son Jesus. He did this because of
                His great love for us. But we must ask for His forgiveness and
                accept this gift. When we do this, he transforms us. If you want
                help in this process, take one of the brown New Testaments and
                look inside the back cover.

              <br />
              <p>
                This good news has been celebrated by literally millions in
                verse and song. See examples below.

              <h3>How Deep the Father's Love for Us</h3>
              <h6>by Stuart Townend</h6>
              <p>
                How deep the Father's love for us,<br />
                How vast beyond all measure<br />
                That He should give His only Son<br />
                To make a wretch His treasure
              </p>
              <p>
                How great the pain of searing loss,<br />
                The Father turns His face away<br />
                As wounds which mar the chosen One,<br />
                Bring many sons to glory
              </p>
              <p>
                Behold the Man upon a cross,<br />
                My sin upon His shoulders<br />
                Ashamed I hear my mocking voice,<br />
                Call out among the scoffers
              </p>
              <p>
                It was my sin that left Him there<br />
                Until it was accomplished<br />
                His dying breath has brought me life<br />
                I know that it is finished
              </p>
              <p>
                I will not boast in anything<br />
                No gifts, no power, no wisdom<br />
                But I will boast in Jesus Christ<br />
                His death and resurrection
              </p>
              <p>
                Why should I gain from His reward?<br />
                I cannot give an answer<br />
                But this I know with all my heart<br />
                His wounds have paid my ransom
              </p>
              <br />

              <h6>

                Larnelle Harris
              </h6>
              <p>
                Time measured out my days, life carried me along <br />
                In my soul I yearned to follow God but knew I'd never be so
                strong
                <br />
                I looked hard at this world to learn how Heaven could be gained
                <br />
                Just to end where I began, where human effort is all in vain
                <br /><br />
                Were it not for grace, I can tell you where I'd be <br />
                Wandering down some pointless road to nowhere <br />
                With my salvation up to me, I know how that would go <br />
                The battles I would face forever running but losing the race
                <br />
                Were it not for grace <br /><br />
                So here is all my praise expressed with all my heart <br />
                Offered to the Friend who took my place and ran a course I could
                not start <br />
                And when He saw in full just how much His love would cost <br />
                He still went the final mile between me and Heaven so I would
                not be lost <br /><br />
                Were it not for grace, I can tell you where I'd be <br />
                Wandering down some pointless road to nowhere <br />
                With my salvation up to me and I know how that would go <br />
                The battles I would face forever running but losing the race
                <br />
                Were it not for grace <br />
                Forever running but losing this race <br />
                Were it not for grace
